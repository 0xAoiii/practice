Vim (Neovim)! It may look intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll navigate and edit text like a pro. Vim operates in three modes:

Normal mode – Where you do most of your work (navigate, delete, copy, etc.).

Insert mode – Where you actually type text.

Visual mode – Where you select text for editing.


1. Insert Mode, you're free to type your heart out. Here’s how to get there:

i – Start typing where the cursor is.

I – Start typing at the beginning of the line.

a – Start typing just after the cursor.

A – Start typing at the end of the line.

o – Open a new line below and start typing.

O – Open a new line above and start typing.

These are your "insert" commands. Easy, right?

2. Normal Mode, you're in control of your text. Here’s how to move around:

Arrow keys – Move up, down, left, or right. (Yes, they work in Normal mode too.)

w – Jump forward by one word.

b – Jump backward by one word.

gg – Go to the top of the file.

Shift + G – Go to the bottom of the file.

Undo and Redo:
u – Undo the last change.

Ctrl + r – Redo what you just undid.

Numbers:
Combine numbers with motions. For example, 5w will move you forward 5 words. No need to keep counting!

3. Visual Mode, want to highlight text? Enter Visual mode:

Press v – Select text one character at a time.

Press V – Select whole lines.

Press Ctrl + v – Select a block of text (good for columns).

Manipulating Selections:
d – Delete the selected text (press it twice to delete the entire line).

y – Copy the selected text (press it twice to copy the whole line).

p – Paste your copied/deleted text.

4. Editing Text, here’s how to do it without breaking a sweat:

c – Change text (deletes the selection and puts you in Insert mode).

r – Replace a single character. For example, rX replaces the current character with "X."

5. More Helpful Shortcuts, to keep things moving, here are some more shortcuts:

d – Delete text (use with a motion or in Visual mode).

y – Copy text.

p – Paste text.

x – Delete the character under the cursor.

. – Repeat the last action. Handy, right?

Scrolling:
Ctrl + f – Scroll down one page.

Ctrl + b – Scroll up one page.
